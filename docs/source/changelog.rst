Upcoming version (not yet released)
-----------------------------------

Added
^^^^^

- Added an opt-in ``footprint_v2`` observation schema for Stage 2D foot-event
  detector training, extending the deployable touchdown inputs with heel/sole
  kinematics, full planar command context, and leg action deltas.
- Added a ``footprint_deploy_v3`` footprint-only detector training preset with
  a 134-dimensional body-frame proprioceptive/FK observation schema, fixed
  deploy-side input scaling metadata, horizontal-support touchdown labels, and
  six-logit compatible dummy toe outputs.
- Added footprint-detector deployment contracts, label-conflict audits, and
  touchdown-only stair hard-negative sampling for footprint-only training.
- Added a footprint-detector-only G1 rollout task with fixed 70/30
  long-stair/grid terrain pools, hard-biased difficulty sampling, and explicit
  long-stair tread-depth variants for deployable footprint detector retraining.
- Added Stage 2D touchdown timing/footprint-anchor validation metrics and
  touchdown false-positive hard-negative mining for footprint detector training.
- Added legacy-baseline auditing and toe-neutral footprint-only scoring to the
  deploy-friendly footprint detector preset, so exported metrics show whether
  the new 134-D observation run beats the strongest saved legacy footprint
  metrics without blocking normal ONNX export.
- Added ``STAIRS_TERRAINS_CFG`` terrain preset for progressive stair
  curriculum training and ``@terrain_preset`` decorator for composing
  terrain configurations from reusable presets.
- Added cartpole balance and swingup tasks (``Mjlab-Cartpole-Balance`` and
  ``Mjlab-Cartpole-Swingup``) with a :ref:`tutorial <tutorial-cartpole>`
  that walks through building an environment from scratch.
- Added :ref:`motion imitation <motion-imitation>` documentation with
  preprocessing instructions. The README now links here instead of the
  BeyondMimic repository, which produced incompatible NPZ files when used
  with mjlab (:issue:`777`).
- Added ``margin``, ``gap``, and ``solmix`` fields to ``CollisionCfg``
  for per geom contact parameter configuration (:issue:`766`).
- NaN guard now captures mocap body poses (``mocap_pos``, ``mocap_quat``)
  when the model has mocap bodies, enabling full state reconstruction in
  the dump viewer for fixed-base entities.
- Implemented ``ActionTermCfg.clip`` for clamping processed actions after
  scale and offset (:issue:`771`).
- Added ``qfrc_actuator`` and ``qfrc_external`` generalized force accessors
  to ``EntityData``. ``qfrc_actuator`` gives actuator forces in joint space
  (projected through the transmission). ``qfrc_external`` recovers the
  generalized force from body external wrenches (``xfrc_applied``)
  (:issue:`776`).
- Added ``RewardBarPanel`` to the Viser viewer, showing horizontal bars for
  each reward term with a running mean over ~1 second (:issue:`800`).
- Added ``per_substep`` flag to ``MetricsTermCfg`` for evaluating metrics
  once per physics substep inside the decimation loop. The per substep
  values are averaged within each environment step, so episode averages
  remain comparable to regular per step metrics.
- Added a Checkpoints tab to the Viser play viewer for hot-swapping
  checkpoints without restarting. Works with local directories and W&B
  runs (:issue:`751`). Contribution by @omarrayyann.
- Added ``"segmentation"`` camera data type for per-pixel geom ID output
  alongside RGB and depth, and a multi-cube goal-conditioned lifting task
  (``Mjlab-Multi-Cube-Seg-Yam``) that uses it (:issue:`862`).
  Contribution by @pthangeda.
- Added live toe-riser contact markers to goal-pyramid velocity play
  evaluation, drawing red dots at newly detected G1 toe/stair-riser
  collision points for the current episode.
- Added a stair lift-height sweep evaluator for goal-pyramid tests, recording
  per-foot swing peak lift across fixed riser heights, fitting lift/predicted
  riser correlations, and auto-selecting legacy G1 eval presets for local
  checkpoints with older actor observation dimensions.
- Added a stair height-transition evaluator that builds a long two-stage
  upward stair runway, lets each stage use a different command-line riser
  height within the training range, and reports first-stage versus post-change
  foot-lift and predicted-riser deltas.
- Added a standalone long stair-runway terrain for G1 target-navigation
  training, with fixed start/end target points, matched high-stair size ranges,
  and runway-specific reset and termination handling.
- Added ``Mjlab-Velocity-Blind-Rough-TargetNavigation-StepDanger-TeacherKL-Unitree-G1``,
  a non-latent G1 target-navigation Teacher-KL task with local foot-lip danger
  parameters and a penalty-only toe-riser danger slab.
- Added privileged stair-shape supervision for slow latent memory and a stage-2
  safe-tread landing reward based on ground-truth tread geometry. Predicted
  geometry is not fed back into reward computation.
- Added reward-neutral SlowLatent stair diagnostics for approach heading,
  layer-2 touchdown gates, and sole support coverage using the existing foot
  volume samples.
- Added an opt-in Semantic-v2 shadow vector for SlowLatent diagnostics. Its
  first eight channels are constructed directly from Event/Stair decisions and
  gate state, while its final eight channels expose normalized physical shape
  and SafeStride values. The shadow vector is detached and is not passed to the
  actor, so enabling it cannot change policy behavior.
- Added the
  ``Mjlab-Velocity-Blind-Rough-TargetNavigation-SemanticV2Shadow-TeacherKL-Unitree-G1``
  task. Its first experiment trains only a structured SafeStride head and
  records Semantic-v2 diagnostics while the actor still consumes the original
  latent memory. Shape supervision remains disabled until SafeStride passes its
  validation gate.
- Added the
  ``Mjlab-Velocity-Blind-Rough-TargetNavigation-SemanticV2SafeStrideProbe-Unitree-G1``
  task. It loads a legacy policy while optimizing only the dynamic SafeStride
  decoders, freezes policy and normalization state, and verifies after every
  update that all non-SafeStride state remains bit-exact.
- Added the
  ``Mjlab-Velocity-Blind-Rough-TargetNavigation-SemanticV2GeometryProbe-Unitree-G1``
  task for testing whether a frozen recurrent policy encodes stair depth and
  height. It supports shape-memory, recurrent-hidden, and combined inputs,
  excludes a deterministic held-out environment subset from training, and
  reports confirmation-age and tread-depth-bin validation metrics. An optional
  permuted-depth-label run provides a null control for spurious decoding.
- Added opt-in stair sequence/event CSV export through
  ``MJLAB_STAIR_EXPORT_DIR`` and reward-neutral confirmation diagnostics using
  raw expected-riser contact as an independent oracle. Events are counted on
  rising edges, while TensorBoard reports precision, recall, false-confirmation,
  duplicate, missed-event, and detection-delay metrics.
- Added a held-out offline stair-interval analysis tool that calibrates physical
  evidence on one rollout seed, selects conflict handling on another, and
  reports support, contact-proxy, fusion, and shuffled-baseline metrics only on
  a final test seed.
- Added version-2 stair evidence logging with sparse adjacent-support trajectory
  events, per-foot/per-layer riser contact edges, contact/riser-relative
  projections, explicit validity fields, and a single-seed descriptive analysis
  mode for comparing first, stable, full, and peak support evidence.
- Added a Stage 2A stair probe dataset exporter that writes deployable
  91-dimensional latent-observation histories with privileged stair labels and
  label-audit summaries for offline probe training.
- Added a Stage 2B offline stair probe trainer for testing whether a
  SlowLatent-sized 16-dimensional bottleneck can decode stair level and tread
  depth from exported deployable latent-observation histories. It includes a
  depth-only upper-bound objective, validation baselines, and class-level
  reports for isolating tread-depth learnability.
- Added an opt-in privileged footprint history to the Stage 2 stair probe
  exporter and trainer for diagnosing whether true foot/tread overlap anchors
  make stair depth learnable from otherwise blind histories, including a
  two-branch fusion probe and coarse three-group depth diagnostics.
- Added SlowLatent foot-event diagnostics for same-foot stride monotonicity,
  including latest-step growth and sample coverage, to track whether stair
  probes are landing progressively farther without adding reward shaping.
- Added SlowLatent foot-event ratchet diagnostics in the existing summary
  channels, exposing monotonic same-foot stride lower bounds, riser-contact
  upper bounds, and derived tread-depth estimates without changing the
  observation size.

Changed
^^^^^^^

- SlowLatent stair probing now rewards both directional stride change and
  reduction of target error, gives a bounded completion bonus near the next
  reference, and removes the positive shortcut for large overshoots. Probe
  references can advance by at most one configured increment per valid
  alternating ``n -> n+2`` touchdown, while a capped reference keeps requesting
  farther motion until the actor actually reaches it. A deployable higher-riser
  collision freezes the fused lock center and first requests a short recovery
  target behind it; recovery rewards both error improvement and proximity before
  switching to center hold. Hold then rewards target-error correction as well as
  centered tracking, with farther/closer/hold semantics using matching bands.
- SlowLatent foot-event ratchet hints now compare each new footprint with the
  previous footprint from the same foot, so post-entry stair probes use the
  actual two-layer swing stride instead of adjacent left-right tread spacing.
- SlowLatent foot-event ratchet hints now close a two-sided stride interval from
  same-foot toe-riser hits, exposing a collision-derived upper bound and
  center target so the actor can reduce stride after contact instead of only
  increasing the probe distance.
- SlowLatent stair-shape supervision now predicts the next same-foot stride
  instead of direct tread depth. Deployable tread-depth diagnostics are derived
  from the same-foot stride interval and the expected layer delta, keeping the
  actor target concrete while preserving depth estimates for analysis. The
  same-foot stride range now uses the existing 0.80 m tracking limit so
  two-layer post-entry strides are not clipped by the shorter SafeStride range.
- SlowLatent stair safe-landing diagnostics now separate touchdown events,
  contact-frame occupancy, and contact-conditioned support ratios, so play logs
  no longer undercount safe landings by dividing event counts by all phase
  frames.
- SlowLatent stair safe-touchdown diagnostics now use an up-stair tread-contact
  denominator for ``stair_safe_touchdown_ratio`` and keep the previous
  all-attempt denominator as ``stair_safe_touchdown_attempt_ratio``. Additional
  expected-tread ratios expose whether the policy is safely landing on the next
  intended stair rather than flat terrain, wrong terrain, or downstairs motion.
- SlowLatent actor semantic conditioning now fuses the same-foot stride head
  with deployable foot-event ratchet hints. Open intervals expose the
  monotonically increasing probe target, while confirmed toe-riser intervals
  expose the ratchet center so the actor can shorten stride after contact
  without adding reward terms.
- SlowLatent shape supervision now includes an optional deployable same-foot
  stride hint loss from the ratchet summary, keeping open probes above the
  observed lower/probe target and using confirmed intervals as a center target.
- Foot-event ratchet diagnostics now include confirmed-only same-foot stride
  and derived tread-depth lower/upper means, and toe-riser upper evidence is
  ignored until an up-stair ratchet context has been activated.
- SlowLatent actor semantic conditioning now replaces the duplicate riser-height
  channel with interval-aware SafeStride lower, upper, center, width, and
  confidence channels for coarse safe-landing trend information.
- Stair attempt tracking now advances to any observed higher tread layer, not
  only the expected layer, keeping the target sequence aligned after skipped
  landings without adding another reward term.
- G1 SlowLatent target-tread midline shaping now caps the combined edge penalty
  and lowers its default edge scale, keeping center/full-support landing reward
  useful without adding a separate probe reward.
- Stair evidence analysis now rejects mis-associated riser contacts, reports
  episode-paired support changes, and evaluates oracle-layer multi-step depth
  estimates causally after two through five independently observed layers.
- Stage 1 stair evidence analysis now rebuilds every multi-layer prefix from
  support events available at that prefix cutoff, reports fixed five-layer
  matched-cohort and paired-improvement statistics, separates valid, invalid,
  and unknown riser-contact associations, and summarizes repeated shuffled-layer
  controls with deterministic bootstrap confidence intervals.
- Stair sequence export now prints rollout metadata and shows a per-step
  progress bar by default, with ``--progress False`` available for quiet batch
  runs.
- Semantic-v2 SafeStride now predicts an ordered physical interval as a lower
  bound plus a positive width constrained by the configured stride range.
  Auxiliary supervision regresses both privileged interval boundaries, while
  the existing scalar SafeStride and ONNX output remain the interval center.
  Legacy one-output SafeStride model weights are upgraded during strict model
  loading; legacy optimizer state must be omitted when starting Semantic-v2.
  The original SlowLatent task keeps its one-output head, checkpoint,
  optimizer, and diagnostics compatibility.
- Split SafeStride supervision into lower-bound and full-interval validity.
  Entry-riser and rear-partial evidence supervise only the observable lower
  bound; upper-bound and width regression starts only after exact later-riser
  evidence confirms the tread interval.
- The Semantic-v2 dynamic SafeStride decoder now combines recurrent history,
  slow geometry memory, and deployable gait phase when predicting the current
  lower bound. A separate slow decoder predicts interval width from geometry
  memory, keeping step-dependent stride correction separate from tread geometry.
- SafeStride interval diagnostics now distinguish center containment from true
  predicted/target interval overlap, coverage, and IoU, and report update-global
  lower, upper, width, and center statistics.
- Semantic-v2 SafeStride probe loss now normalizes observable lower-bound and
  confirmed-width regression independently. Dynamic width is decoded in
  absolute physical units instead of being scaled by the predicted lower bound;
  upper remains a derived diagnostic.
- Prepared Semantic-v2 Shape supervision with independent component masks. Riser
  height remains valid throughout an accepted stair sequence, while tread depth
  becomes valid only after reaching or colliding with layer 2 or a later
  expected layer. Both masks are training-only privileged labels and are zero
  outside active stair sequences. The Shadow task does not enable this loss in
  its first SafeStride-only training phase.
- Training resume configuration can now skip optimizer moments and the saved
  iteration counter. Semantic-v2 Shadow uses both options so expanded physical
  heads can bootstrap from a legacy actor checkpoint with a fresh optimizer.
  ``bootstrap_checkpoint_path`` can load that checkpoint directly into a fresh
  experiment without copying it into the new experiment directory. Training
  checkpoint loads now map tensors to the selected training device, allowing
  CUDA checkpoints to be validated or resumed on CPU.
- Slow-latent moving training commands now span 0.4--1.0 m/s, with the upper
  bound expanding from 0.8 to 1.0 m/s at the existing curriculum transition.
  Standing environments remain at zero speed. Play evaluation now samples
  0.6--0.9 m/s instead of 0.3--0.9 m/s.
- Added a 5 cm per-leg shank clearance penalty with weight ``-2.0`` for
  slow-latent stairs. It measures clearance from the actual G1 shank collision
  capsule, including its knee-side cap, to the next sequence-local tread edge.
  Matching layer, ascent direction, and lateral coverage remain required.
- Slow-latent SafeStride supervision now alternates its training-only target
  foot after every completed swing attempt, regardless of landing quality.
  The reached layer advances only when that attempt contacts the expected
  tread, so partial tread contact advances while riser hits and misses keep
  the same expected layer for the opposite foot. SafeStride supervision uses
  the interval of translations that keeps every sole proxy point inside the
  requested tread, with zero loss anywhere inside that interval. Higher-layer
  skips are penalized and no longer receive the safe-landing reward. Shape
  loss remains disabled, SafeStride decodes over 0.10--0.55 m, and attempt,
  interval, exactness, skip, and clamp diagnostics are reported. Targets beyond
  the 0.80 m single-step tracking limit are excluded from supervision and reset
  stale stair sequences instead of being clamped into the training set.
  Any positive tread overlap still advances alternating foot bookkeeping, but
  only complete sole containment counts as full support.
- Slow-latent SafeStride now supervises the opposite-foot recovery stride to
  layer 1 immediately after a stair-entry collision. Deployable abrupt or
  persistent blocking at a soft expected-riser contact no longer requires the
  collision-penalty force threshold to count as training evidence. Entry-riser
  and expected-riser evidence receive 3x loss importance, while rear-partial
  tread contacts receive 2x importance. Evidence now remains emphasized for
  15 frames before returning to ordinary sequence supervision.
- Expected-riser events during stair memory now temporarily update only the
  shape/stride latent channels at the normal fast rate for 15 frames. Stair-state
  channels remain frozen, and the gate does not re-enter full WRITE.
- Added a default-off ``--zero-shape-latent`` play option that zeros only the
  shape-memory copy passed to the actor. Internal recurrent memory and
  auxiliary-head predictions continue running unchanged for controlled
  inference ablations.
- Added a less destructive, default-off
  ``--freeze-shape-latent-at-stair-entry`` play ablation. It preserves normal
  walking conditioning, snapshots shape memory immediately before WRITE, and
  feeds that snapshot only to the actor throughout WRITE/MEMORY while internal
  recurrent memory and auxiliary heads continue updating.
- Slow-latent stair depth predictions now cover 0.23--0.37 m. Every curriculum
  level contains eight total fixed tread-depth variants spanning 0.25--0.35 m,
  split between high-stair and inverted-high-stair terrain by their configured
  spawning proportions.
- ShapeHead now computes its masked Huber loss after independently normalizing
  tread depth and riser height by their configured physical ranges. Physical
  MAE diagnostics and decoded policy outputs remain in meters.
- ShapeHead geometry labels are now latched from the accepted stair sequence at
  entry and supervise the complete active sequence instead of starting only
  after a safe layer-2 touchdown. Training logs now report valid stair
  coverage and whether predictions track the variation in true stair sizes.
- Slow-latent stair entry now uses explicit training-only sequence and
  entry-relative layer metadata, so regular and inverted stairs agree on the
  first riser. Event supervision now detects deployable swing-motion blocking:
  an abrupt loss of forward foot progress triggers immediately, while a
  low-speed vertical contact triggers after three persistent frames. Contact
  force remains a collision-severity diagnostic and penalty input but is no
  longer an Event gate. Repeated layer-1 blocking can provide new Event
  evidence when the first trigger was missed. The privileged stair label
  remains active until geometric flat exit confirmation.
- Slow-latent WRITE now requires consecutive StairHead evidence and performs
  every configured fast-write update before entering MEMORY. StairHead uses
  the same proprioceptive LSTM output for training and gating, while MEMORY
  freezes state channels and continues refreshing shape channels. Deployment
  observations are unchanged, and no new reward term was added.
- Slow-latent stair gating now requires three consecutive confirmation frames
  and treats StairHead probabilities below 0.20 as MEMORY exit evidence. New
  diagnostics track repeated layer-1 hits after entry without changing reward.
- Slow-latent MEMORY exit now releases held state and shape channels over the
  existing 15-step cooldown instead of immediately switching to the normal
  latent update rate.
- Slow-latent stair geometry and safe-stride heads now decode to physical ranges
  in meters and are exported as explicit ONNX outputs without changing the actor
  control input. Stair depth is fixed to 0.18--0.35 m and riser height is bounded
  to 0.088--0.25 m. Label range violations are logged without clamping targets.
- Replaced the slow-latent future-entry proxy with independent continuous
  collision-risk and next-touchdown-quality heads. Stage-2 landing shaping now
  increases smoothly with sole support, landing-center accuracy, and edge
  clearance while retaining the 60% state-machine memory-valid threshold.
- Slow-latent stair entry now starts from a heading-gated first-riser contact and
  advances to stair-following only after the opposite foot safely lands on the
  second tread with at least 60% sole support. The state machine records the
  observed stride, validated landing center, and tread-depth lower bound, and
  exits stale entry/following states on timeouts or after passing the last riser.
- Removed collision exploration, first-contact protection, and entry
  lift/forward shaping from slow-latent stair rewards. Riser, slab, and lip
  danger penalties remain active, while heading-aligned stair entry and
  following use the same phase-free alternating gait reward.
- Slow-latent G1 foot-lip danger penalties now stay active on the first two
  stair boundary layers instead of skipping them during stair entry.
- Slow-latent G1 Teacher-KL training now stops requesting teacher/camera
  observations after the teacher guidance weight has fully annealed to zero.
- Slow-latent auxiliary labels now use the env-side stair-entry pulse, stair
  phase, and safe-stride validity directly while retaining the existing
  event/stair/shape ordering. Stage-2 following landings target the validated
  landing center plus a bounded 4 cm lead from stair layer three onward.
- Extended slow-latent supervision to seven values with a masked safe-tread
  lower-bound head and PPO loss. The persistent latent now reserves separate
  state/timing and geometry/stride channels, using hold update rates of 0.01
  and 0.05 respectively in training and exported ONNX policies.
- Added slow-latent stair/env phase mismatch diagnostics, trajectory-level
  write/memory entry metrics, and shorter default memory-exit timing for
  diagnosing stale stair memory after leaving stairs.
- Slow-latent stair memory now requires stair-state confirmation before
  promoting a sparse entry event from write mode into persistent memory,
  reducing false stair-memory holds on flat ground.
- Slow-latent event-head supervision now labels only strict stair-entry events,
  while arbitrary toe-riser hits remain collision/risk signals instead of WRITE
  trigger targets.
- Slow-latent stair-state supervision and stair-aware gait now use a short
  recent stair-entry evidence window, keeping stair context separate from later
  riser-collision traces.
- Slow-latent event/stair gate defaults are more conservative, with a shorter
  event label window and lower event positive weight for better calibration.
- Slow-latent stair gating now treats the event head as a write proposal,
  requires repeated stair-head evidence across the write window, and uses
  sustained stair-off evidence instead of the one-shot event head to leave
  memory. Training logs now report threshold-specific head accuracy and gate
  transition outcomes.
- Slow-latent stair context now remains active from the first accepted riser
  entry until two explicit flat touchdown events confirm the end of the
  staircase. Entry/following timeouts and rejected safe landings no longer
  clear stair-state supervision mid-staircase.
- Slow-latent stair following now exits through a two-flat-touchdown
  confirmation instead of resetting immediately after passing the last stair
  boundary, making the stair-to-flat transition state explicit.
- G1 high-stair curriculum tasks now enable mixed terrain replay after
  reaching high levels, sampling low/mid/high stair rows at a 20/30/50 ratio.
- G1 high-stair terrains now randomize stair step depth per tile from
  25 cm to 35 cm across curriculum difficulty rows.
- G1 high-stair play terrain randomization now uses the same low/mid/high
  level ratio as mixed replay while preserving randomized stair depth.
- Actuator delay is now configured inline on any ``ActuatorCfg`` subclass
  (e.g. ``BuiltinPositionActuatorCfg(..., delay_min_lag=2, delay_max_lag=5)``)
  instead of wrapping with ``DelayedActuatorCfg``. ``DelayedActuator``,
  ``DelayedActuatorCfg``, and ``DelayedBuiltinActuatorGroup`` are removed.
- Removed ``delay_target`` from ``ActuatorCfg``. Delay now always applies to
  the actuator's ``command_field`` automatically. Multi-target delay
  (``delay_target=("position", "velocity")``) is no longer supported.
- ``XmlPositionActuatorCfg``, ``XmlVelocityActuatorCfg``, ``XmlMotorActuatorCfg``,
  and ``XmlMuscleActuatorCfg`` are replaced by a single ``XmlActuatorCfg`` that auto
  detects the actuator type from XML. Pass ``command_field=...`` to override detection.
- Replaced the viser viewer internals with the ``mjviser`` package. Scene
  creation, mesh conversion, and overlay rendering (contacts, forces,
  inertia, tendons, joints, frames) are now provided by mjviser. The viewer
  exposes a new Visualization tab for overlay controls and a Groups tab for
  geom/site visibility. Debug visualization and warp tensor conversion remain
  in mjlab's ``MjlabViserScene`` subclass (:issue:`839`).
- In curriculum terrain mode, each terrain type now gets exactly one column
  (``num_cols`` is set to ``len(sub_terrains)``). The ``proportion`` field
  now controls robot spawning distribution across columns rather than column
  count. Random mode is unchanged (:issue:`811`).
- ``BoxSteppingStonesTerrainCfg`` stone size now decreases with difficulty,
  interpolating from the large end of ``stone_size_range`` at difficulty 0
  to the small end at difficulty 1 (:issue:`785`).
- Removed deprecated ``TerrainImporter`` and ``TerrainImporterCfg`` aliases.
  Use ``TerrainEntity`` and ``TerrainEntityCfg`` instead (:issue:`667`).
- ``Entity.clear_state()`` is deprecated. Use ``Entity.reset()`` instead.
  ``clear_state`` only zeroed actuator targets without resetting actuator
  internal state (e.g. delay buffers), which could cause stale commands
  after teleporting the robot to a new pose.
- Removed ``EntityData.generalized_force``. The property was bugged (indexed
  free joint DOFs instead of articulated DOFs) and the name was ambiguous.
  Use ``qfrc_actuator`` or ``qfrc_external`` instead (:issue:`776`).

Fixed
^^^^^

- SafeStride full-interval supervision now requires a confirmed collision with
  the expected layer-2-or-later riser. Layer-1 repeats and tread contact continue
  to supervise only the lower bound. Training logs distinguish interval-valid
  frames from one-shot unique depth-confirmation events.
- Fixed ONNX export path resolution in the velocity, manipulation, and
  tracking runners when a parent directory name contains the word
  ``"model"`` (:issue:`867`). Contribution by @gokulp01.
- ``export-scene`` now writes only referenced assets and places them
  correctly under the output directory. Previously, asset keys containing
  path traversal could write files outside the output directory, and all
  spec assets were included regardless of whether the scene XML referenced
  them (:issue:`858`).
- ``electrical_power_cost`` now uses ``qfrc_actuator`` (joint space) instead
  of ``actuator_force`` (actuation space) for mechanical power computation.
  Previously the reward was incorrect for actuators with gear ratios other
  than 1 (:issue:`776`).
- ``create_velocity_actuator`` no longer sets ``ctrllimited=True`` with
  ``inheritrange=1.0``. This caused a ``ValueError`` for continuous joints
  (e.g. wheels) that have no position range defined (:issue:`787`).
- ``write_root_com_velocity_to_sim`` no longer fails with tensor ``env_ids``
  on floating base entities (:issue:`793`).
- Joint limits for unlimited joints are now set to [-inf, inf] instead of
  [0, 0]. Previously the zero range caused incorrect clamping for entities
  with unlimited hinge or slide joints.
- Contact force visualization now copies ``ctrl`` into the CPU ``MjData``
  before calling ``mj_forward``. Actuators that compute torques in Python
  (``DcMotorActuator``, ``IdealPdActuator``) previously showed incorrect
  contact forces because the viewer ran with ``ctrl=0``
  (:issue:`786`).
- ``BoxSteppingStonesTerrainCfg`` no longer creates a large gap around the
  platform. Stones are now only skipped when their center falls inside the
  platform; edges that extend under the platform are allowed since the
  platform covers them (:issue:`785`).
- ``dr.pseudo_inertia`` no longer loads cuSOLVER, eliminating ~4 GB of
  persistent GPU memory overhead. Cholesky and eigendecomposition are now
  computed analytically for the small matrices involved (4x4 and 3x3)
  (:issue:`753`).
- Set terrain geom mass to zero so that the static terrain body does not
  inflate ``stat.meanmass``, which made force arrow visualization invisible
  on rough terrain (:issue:`734`, :issue:`537`).
- Native viewer now syncs ``qpos0`` when domain randomized, fixing incorrect
  body positions after ``dr.joint_default_pos`` randomization
  (:issue:`760`).
- ``command_manager.compute()`` is now called during ``reset()`` so that
  derived command state (e.g. relative body positions in tracking
  environments) is populated before the first observation is returned
  (:issue:`761`).
- ``RayCastSensor`` with ``ray_alignment="yaw"`` or ``"world"`` now correctly
  aligns the frame offset when attached to a site or geom with a local offset
  from its parent body. Previously only ray directions and pattern offsets were
  aligned, causing the frame position to swing with body pitch/roll
  (:issue:`775`).

Version 1.2.0 (March 6, 2026)
-----------------------------

.. admonition:: Breaking API changes
   :class: attention

   - ``randomize_field`` no longer exists. Replace calls with typed functions
     from the new ``dr`` module (e.g. ``dr.geom_friction``, ``dr.body_mass``).
   - ``EventTermCfg`` no longer accepts ``domain_randomization``. The
     ``@requires_model_fields`` decorator on each ``dr`` function takes care
     of field expansion automatically.
   - ``Scene.to_zip()`` is deprecated. Use ``Scene.write(path, zip=True)``.
   - ``RslRlModelCfg`` no longer accepts ``stochastic``, ``init_noise_std``,
     or ``noise_std_type``. Use ``distribution_cfg`` instead
     (e.g. ``{"class_name": "GaussianDistribution", "init_std": 1.0,
     "std_type": "scalar"}``). Existing checkpoints are automatically
     migrated on load.

Added
^^^^^

- Added ``"step"`` event mode that fires every environment step.
- Added ``apply_body_impulse`` event for applying transient external wrenches
  to bodies with configurable duration and optional application point offset.
- ONNX auto-export and metadata attachment for manipulation tasks (lift cube)
  on every checkpoint save, matching the velocity and tracking task behavior.
- Multi-frame ``RayCastSensor``: pass a tuple of ``ObjRef`` to ``frame`` for
  per-site raycasting with independent body exclusion. New properties:
  ``num_frames``, ``num_rays_per_frame``. New ``RayCastData`` fields:
  ``frame_pos_w`` and ``frame_quat_w``.
- ``RingPatternCfg`` ray pattern for concentric ring sampling around each
  frame.
- ``TerrainHeightSensor``, a ``RayCastSensor`` subclass that computes
  per-frame vertical clearance above terrain (``sensor.data.heights``).
  Velocity task configs now use it for ``feet_clearance``,
  ``feet_swing_height``, and ``foot_height``, replacing the previous
  world-Z proxy that was incorrect on rough terrain.
- Cloud training support via `SkyPilot <https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/>`_
  and Lambda Cloud, with documentation covering setup, monitoring, and
  cost management.
- W&B hyperparameter sweep scripts that distribute one agent per GPU
  across a multi-GPU instance.
- Contributing guide with documentation for shared Claude Code commands
  (``/update-mjwarp``, ``/commit-push-pr``).
- Added optional ``ViewerConfig.fovy`` and apply it in native viewer camera
  setup when provided.
- Native viewer now tracks the first non-fixed body by default (matching
  the Viser viewer behavior introduced in
  ``716aaaa58ad7bfaf34d2f771549d461204d1b4ba``).
- New ``dr`` module (``mjlab.envs.mdp.dr``) replacing ``randomize_field``
  with typed per-field domain randomization functions. Each function
  automatically recomputes derived fields via ``set_const``. Highlights:

  - Camera and light randomization: ``dr.cam_fovy``, ``dr.cam_pos``,
    ``dr.cam_quat``, ``dr.cam_intrinsic``, ``dr.light_pos``,
    ``dr.light_dir``. Camera and light names are now supported in
    ``SceneEntityCfg`` (``camera_names`` / ``light_names``).
  - ``dr.pseudo_inertia`` for physics-consistent randomization of
    ``body_mass``, ``body_ipos``, ``body_inertia``, and ``body_iquat``
    via the pseudo-inertia matrix parameterization (Rucker & Wensing
    2022). Replaces the removed ``dr.body_inertia`` /
    ``dr.body_iquat``.
  - ``dr.geom_size`` with automatic recomputation of ``geom_rbound``
    and ``geom_aabb`` for broadphase consistency.
  - ``dr.tendon_armature`` and ``dr.tendon_frictionloss``.
  - ``dr.body_quat``, ``dr.geom_quat``, and ``dr.site_quat`` with RPY
    perturbation composed onto the default quaternion.
  - Extensible ``Operation`` and ``Distribution`` types. Users can define
    custom operations and distributions as class instances and pass them
    anywhere a string is accepted. Built-in instances (``dr.abs``,
    ``dr.scale``, ``dr.add``, ``dr.uniform``, ``dr.log_uniform``,
    ``dr.gaussian``) are exported from the ``dr`` module.
  - ``dr.mat_rgba`` for per-world material color randomization. Tints
    the texture color, useful for randomizing appearance of textured
    surfaces. Material names are now supported in ``SceneEntityCfg``
    (``material_names``).
  - Fixed ``dr.effort_limits`` drifting on repeated randomization.
  - Fixed ``dr.body_com_offset`` not triggering ``set_const``.

- ``export-scene`` CLI script to export any task scene or asset_zoo entity
  (``g1``, ``go1``, ``yam``) to a directory or zip archive for inspection
  and debugging.

- ``yam_lift_cube_vision_env_cfg`` now randomizes cube color (``dr.geom_rgba``)
  on every reset when ``cam_type="rgb"``.

- The native viewer now reflects per-world DR changes to visual model fields
  on each reset. Geom appearance, body and site poses, camera parameters,
  and light positions are all synced from the GPU model before rendering.
  Inertia boxes (press ``I``) and camera frustums (press ``Q``) update
  correctly when the corresponding fields are randomized. See
  :doc:`randomization` for viewer-specific caveats.

- ``MaterialCfg.geom_names_expr`` for assigning materials to geoms by
  name pattern during ``edit_spec``.

- ``TerrainEntityCfg`` now exposes ``textures``, ``materials``, and
  ``lights`` as configurable fields (previously hardcoded). Set
  ``textures=()``, ``materials=()`` to use flat ``dr.geom_rgba``
  instead of the default checker texture.

- ``DebugVisualizer`` now supports ellipsoid visualization via
  ``add_ellipsoid``.

- Interactive velocity joystick sliders in the Viser viewer. Enable the
  joystick under Commands/Twist to override velocity commands with manual
  sliders for ``lin_vel_x``, ``lin_vel_y``, and ``ang_vel_z``
  (`#666 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/issues/666>`_).
- Per-term debug visualization toggles in the Viser viewer. Individual
  command term visualizers (e.g. velocity arrows) can now be toggled
  independently under Scene/Debug Viz.
- Viewer single-step mode: press RIGHT arrow (native) or click "Step"
  (Viser) to advance exactly one physics step while paused.
- Viewer error recovery: exceptions during stepping now pause the viewer
  and log the traceback instead of crashing the process.
- Native viewer runs forward kinematics while paused, keeping
  perturbation visuals accurate.
- Viewer speed multipliers use clean power-of-2 fractions (1/32x to 1x).

- Visualizers display the realtime factor alongside FPS.

- ``joint_torques_l2`` now respects ``SceneEntityCfg.actuator_ids``,
  allowing penalization of a subset of actuators instead of all of them
  (`#703 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/pull/703>`_). Contribution by
  `@saikishor <https://github.com/saikishor>`_.

- Terrain is now a proper ``Entity`` subclass (``TerrainEntity``). This
  allows domain randomization functions to target terrain parameters
  (friction, cameras, lights) via ``SceneEntityCfg("terrain", ...)``.
  ``TerrainImporter`` / ``TerrainImporterCfg`` remain as aliases but will be
  deprecated in a future version.
- Added ``upload_model`` option to ``RslRlBaseRunnerCfg`` to control W&B model
  file uploads (``.pt`` and ``.onnx``) while keeping metric logging enabled
  (`#654 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/pull/654>`_).
- ``Scene.write(output_dir, zip=False)`` exports the scene XML and mesh
  assets to a directory (or zip archive). Replaces ``Scene.to_zip()``.
- ``Entity.write_xml()`` and ``Scene.write()`` now apply XML fixups
  (empty defaults, duplicate nested defaults) and strip buffer textures
  that ``MjSpec.to_xml()`` cannot serialize.
- ``fix_spec_xml`` and ``strip_buffer_textures`` utilities in
  ``mjlab.utils.xml``.

Changed
^^^^^^^

- Native viewer now syncs ``xfrc_applied`` to the render buffer and draws
  arrows for any nonzero applied forces. Mouse perturbation forces are
  converted to ``qfrc_applied`` (generalized joint space) so they coexist
  with programmatic forces on ``xfrc_applied`` without conflict.
- ``ViewerConfig.OriginType.WORLD`` now configures a free camera at the
  specified lookat point instead of auto tracking a body. A new ``AUTO``
  origin type (now the default) preserves the previous auto tracking
  behavior.
- Upgraded ``rsl-rl-lib`` from 4.0.1 to 5.0.1. ``RslRlModelCfg`` now
  uses ``distribution_cfg`` dict instead of ``stochastic`` /
  ``init_noise_std`` / ``noise_std_type``. Existing checkpoints are
  automatically migrated on load.
- Reorganized the Viser Controls tab into a cleaner folder hierarchy:
  Info, Simulation, Commands, Scene (with Environment, Camera, Debug Viz,
  Contacts sub-folders), and Camera Feeds. The Environment folder is
  hidden for single-env tasks and the Commands folder is hidden when no
  command terms are active.
- Viser camera tracking is now enabled by default so the agent stays in
  frame on launch.
- Self collision and illegal contact sensors now use ``history_length`` to
  catch contacts across decimation substeps. Reward and termination functions
  read ``force_history`` with a configurable ``force_threshold``.
- Replaced the single ``scale`` parameter in ``DifferentialIKActionCfg`` with
  separate ``delta_pos_scale`` and ``delta_ori_scale`` for independent scaling
  of position and orientation components.
- Improved offscreen multi environment framing by selecting neighboring
  environments around the focused env instead of first N envs.
- Tuned tracking task viewer defaults for tighter camera framing.
- Disabled shadow casting on the G1 tracking light to avoid duplicate
  stacked shadows when robots are close.

Fixed
^^^^^

- Fixed actuator target resolution for entities whose ``spec_fn`` uses
  internal ``MjSpec.attach(prefix=...)``
  (`#709 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/issues/709>`_).
- Fixed viewer physics loop starving the renderer by replacing the single
  sim-time budget with a two-clock design (tracked vs actual sim time).
  Physics now self-corrects after overshooting, keeping FPS smooth at all
  speed multipliers.
- Bundled ``ffmpeg`` for ``mediapy`` via ``imageio-ffmpeg``, removing the
  requirement for a system ``ffmpeg`` install. Thanks to
  `@rdeits-bd <https://github.com/rdeits-bd>`_ for the suggestion.
- Fixed ``height_scan`` returning ~0 for missed rays; now defaults to
  ``max_distance``. Replaced ``clip=(-1, 1)`` with ``scale`` normalization
  in the velocity task config. Thanks to `@eufrizz <https://github.com/eufrizz>`_
  for reporting and the initial fix (`#642 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/pull/642>`_).
- Fixed ghost mesh visualization for fixed-base entities by extending
  ``DebugVisualizer.add_ghost_mesh`` to optionally accept ``mocap_pos`` and
  ``mocap_quat`` (`#645 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/pull/645>`_).
- Fixed viser viewer crashing on scenes with no mocap bodies by adding
  an ``nmocap`` guard, matching the native viewer behavior.
- Fixed offscreen rendering artifacts in large vectorized scenes by applying
  a render local extent override in ``OffscreenRenderer`` and restoring the
  original extent on close.
- Fixed ``RslRlVecEnvWrapper.unwrapped`` to return the base environment,
  ensuring checkpoint state restore and logging work correctly when wrappers
  such as ``VideoRecorder`` are enabled.

Version 1.1.1 (February 14, 2026)
---------------------------------

Added
^^^^^

- Added reward term visualization to the native viewer (toggle with ``P``) (`#629 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/pull/629>`_).
- Added ``DifferentialIKAction`` for task-space control via damped
  least-squares IK. Supports weighted position/orientation tracking,
  soft joint-limit avoidance, and null-space posture regularization.
  Includes an interactive viser demo (``scripts/demos/differential_ik.py``) (`#632 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/pull/632>`_).

Fixed
^^^^^

- Fixed ``play.py`` defaulting to the base rsl-rl ``OnPolicyRunner`` instead
  of ``MjlabOnPolicyRunner``, which caused a ``TypeError`` from an unexpected
  ``cnn_cfg`` keyword argument (`#626 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/pull/626>`_). Contribution by
  `@griffinaddison <https://github.com/griffinaddison>`_.

Changed
^^^^^^^

- Removed ``body_mass``, ``body_inertia``, ``body_pos``, and ``body_quat``
  from ``FIELD_SPECS`` in domain randomization. These fields have derived
  quantities that require ``set_const`` to recompute; without that call,
  randomizing them silently breaks physics (`#631 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/pull/631>`_).
- Replaced ``moviepy`` with ``mediapy`` for video recording. ``mediapy``
  handles cloud storage paths (GCS, S3) natively (`#637 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/pull/637>`_).

  exporter with rsl-rl's built-in ``as_onnx()`` (`#589 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/pull/589>`_, `#595 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/pull/595>`_).
- ``sim.forward()`` is now called unconditionally after the decimation
  loop. See :ref:`faq-sim-forward` for details (`#591 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/pull/591>`_).
- Unnamed freejoints are now automatically named to prevent
  ``KeyError`` during entity init (`#545 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/pull/545>`_).

- Fixed ``ctrl_ids`` index error with multiple actuated entities (`#573 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/pull/573>`_).
  Reported by `@bwrooney82 <https://github.com/bwrooney82>`_.
- Fixed Viser viewer rendering textured robots as gray (`#544 <https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab/pull/544>`_).
